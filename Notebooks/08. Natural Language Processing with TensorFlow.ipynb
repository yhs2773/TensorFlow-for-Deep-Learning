We've got a training set and a validation set containing Tweets and labels.\n","\n","Our labels are in numerical form (`0` and `1`) but our Tweets are in string form.\n","\n","> 🤔 Question: What do you think we have to do before we can use a machine-learning algorithm with our text data?\n","\n","If you answered something along the lines of \"turn it into numbers\", you're correct. A machine learning algorithm requires its inputs to be in numerical form.\n","\n","In NLP, there are two main concepts for turning text into numbers:\n","\n","- **Tokenization** - A straight mapping from a word or character or sub-word to a numerical value. There are three main levels of tokenization:\n","    - Using **word-level tokenization** with the sentence \"I love TensorFlow\" might result in \"I\" being `0`, \"love\" being `1` and \"TensorFlow\" being `2`. In this case, every word in a sequence is considered a single **token**.\n","    - **Character-level tokenization**, such as converting the letters A-Z to values `1-26`. In this case, every character in a sequence is considered a single **token**.\n","    - **Sub-word tokenization** is in between word-level and character-level tokenization. It involves breaking individual words into smaller parts and then converting those smaller parts into numbers. For example, \"my favorite food is pineapple pizza\" might become \"my, fav, avor, rite, fo, oo, od, is, pin, ine, app, le, piz, za\". After doing this, these sub-words would then be mapped to a numerical value. In this case, every word could be considered multiple tokens.\n","- **Embeddings** - An embedding is a representation of natural language that can be learned. Representation comes in the form of a **feature vector**. For example, the word \"dance\" could be represented by the 5-dimensional vector `[-0.8547, 0.4559, -0.3332, 0.9877, 0.1112]`. It's important to note here, the size of the feature vector is tuneable. There are two ways to use embeddings:\n","    - **Create your own embedding** - Once your text has been turned into numbers (required for an embedding), you can put them through an embedding layer (such as [`tf.keras.layers.Embedding`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding)) and an embedding representation will be learned during model training.\n","    - **Reuse a pre-learned embedding** - Many pre-trained embeddings exist online. These pre-trained embeddings have often been learned on large corpora of text (such as all of Wikipedia) and thus have a good underlying representation of natural language. You can use a pre-trained embedding to initialize your model and fine-tune it to your specific task.\n","\n","![image2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/main/images/08-tokenization-vs-embedding.png)\n","*Example of **tokenization** (straight mapping from word to number) and **embedding** (richer representation of relationships between tokens).*\n","\n","> 🤔 Question: What level of tokenization should I use? What embedding should I choose?\n","\n","It depends on your problem. You could try character-level tokenization/embeddings and word-level tokenization/embeddings and see which performs best. You might even want to try stacking them (e.g. combining the outputs of your embedding layers using [`tf.keras.layers.concatenate`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/concatenate)).\n","\n","If you're looking for pre-trained word embeddings, [Word2vec embeddings](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/), [GloVe embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and many of the options available on [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=text-embedding) are great places to start.\n","\n","> 🔑 Note: Much like searching for a pre-trained computer vision model, you can search for pre-trained word embeddings to use for your problem.
